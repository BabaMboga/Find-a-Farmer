## Description
This is a single paged application that allows users to buy and sell different products. We  are basically connecting the farmer to wholesale and retail customers across Kenya and eliminating the menace of the broker who buys the goods cheaply and sells them expensively reducing the farmers profits by a lot. Users can see which items are in stock and where they can be found and only allows the user to buy when there is stock of the product. The user can also get updates on Find a Farmer news and can get access to our exclusive Multi-Layered Insurance for the farmers.
