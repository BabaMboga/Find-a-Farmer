## Description

This is a single paged platform that allows users to buy and sell different agricultural products that meet their desires and at affordable prices. We are basically connecting the farmer to wholesale and retail customers across Kenya and eliminating the menace of the broker who buys the goods cheaply and sells them expensively reducing the farmers profits by a lot. Users can see which items are in stock and where they can be found and only allows the user to buy when there is stock of the product. The user can also get updates on Find a Farmer news and can get access to our exclusive Multi-Layered Insurance for the farmers. The farmer can also delete a product that displeases him or is out of stock. The buy button is only active when there is available stock and will disable and change the text once stock is finished. The add button will be added later in the larger project.
